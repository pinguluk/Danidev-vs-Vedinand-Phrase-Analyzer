can add a differetn chest type that is more expensive but gives 2 options?
i know other people messed with the leaderboards, but i never saw any links or malicious names
i mean if you can find me proof that this happened ill apologize and unban you
you didnt say that in your initial message, you edited it now....
so whats the reason?
if you find an exploit like that and brick the leaderboards, maybe dont leave it up for hours
i get hundreds of dms every day and as i said i was on vacation
......
im pissed okay
you literally left it up for hours when you could've just dm'd me WHILE I WAS ON VACATION
really wanna do this but right now theres so many other things people want me to fix lol
<:VedThumb:1420426915701067879>
üõå
im going to bed ill fix it tomorrow
cant wait
id rather work on the fucking game than fix this shit but it is what it is lol
just wanted to check it was showing ty
okay sick thanks
hey can anyone check the leaderboards? what does it say?
he calls it survivorsslop üíÄ
he is literally #1 megabonk hater <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
oh yeah 100% im just getting started
super busy with megabonk updates <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
<:VedThumb:1420426915701067879>
thanks bro
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
bruh
thats pretty funny, ill look into how possible it is to flatten an enemy without completely breaking the game
LOL
thats kind of a sick idea
that can be done
It might be rip, what kinda freeze are we talking?
dont think so
yeah it's rough for indie / small studios
for now it seems they are a dead community, so i think i will ignore them
yeah
reddit was telling me my game would never succeed with that name <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
so fucking annoying, but it seems that they have stopped spamming my posts now? Im not sure whether to ignore or to announce that im not affiliated, because announcing that would give them some attention
GDPR making stuff like this hard af, but also it's very important that we have GDPR ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
idk i couldnt come up with a name so i just chose the first and dumbest thing that came to mind
nah no way, but most cheaters are filtered out
whaaat i love blender
:)
also if i store run data i have to link it with Steamids, and now im suddenly dealing with private information and GDPR will fuck me
Would be sick but that would also require me to store run data and create an entire replay system, which sounds wonky af
tyruuee
no lmaoo just cool strats
it is but he used forbidden tech
it is
*but have you heard about triple anvil*
double anvil is insane
holy fuck
HOLY
DONT
I think it has more to do with the speedbois triggering something weird but idk, cant seem to reproduce it
good job
you are clincally insane
thats insane
this bug has been haunting me
okay, i tried to fix this problem in the new update, i hope it's fixed üíÄ
is that even on the new update?
what version?
oh right
what was the bug
if you wanna call that a nerf (fuck you kevin)
well the invincibility "bug" with kevin is going
nothing is being nerfed i think
hypothetically
go into the save file directory 

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\Ved\Megabonk\Saves\CloudDir

and copy the files from your 69 folder (pirated folder) to your steamid folder
go in <#1421978066208690196> and get the role
oh the one happenign at the start of the run?
what is it
you just turn into a giant boulder
idk but its super fun with quantity and size tomes
okay ty
yoo can someone try to react to the message in <#1421978066208690196> <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
hop on <#1323666051866558565>  if anyone wanna help me test it :)))
10x yeah
Was always capped, it just didnt display the cap
double the chance of normal mobs
thatd be sooo OP
nope
god damn
proj speed affects it yeah
did you die in a specific way? did you play bush?
yeah seems to randomly happen sometimes, cant seem to figure it out
only urns i think
aight guys im going back to workign on update ‚úåÔ∏è
uuuh good question
uuuh not really tbh, but in one of my shorts you can see a ton of them, and also if you scroll up in <#1323666051866558565>  you can find a bunch
i think hes working towards it
i dont think anyone has 100% in-game quests, thats probably fucked
wasnt hat just steam achievements?
<:kevin:1419298615955947645>
he does like you
actually wait yes youre right
‚õî
guys kevin has a terrible secret....
but yes, very happy with launch :))
just been super busy working on updates
hes been at it for a year straight now
dont mind him hes the server gooner
chat was about to kill me before i even nerfed it
nah didnt get nerfed
yeah idk why its still going up and not down lol
uuh once i create some tools to export all localizations and get them all up on some place where people can help me translate
i thought maybe we would sell 10k copies and thatd be pog
no LOL
you got a point
LOL yeah
gg
i havent slept much
and i refuse to share it
i have a forbidden build
robinette is like BIS right now imo
you heard it here first
and ogre
nah the new goat is gonna be robinette
yeah beacon gives +2 shrines for all future stages, so stacking wrenches with beacon is pretty strong
his passive is now stronger early game, but falls of when you get to a really high level
most other things are buffs
which everyone has been complaining about
theres literally only one enrf and it's the dice....
only difference would be if you used dice
beta and live is literally no difference in balancing when it comes to enemies
what character are you playing?
gives back 1 after every phase
just a patch
you need to restart steam
<#1323666051866558565>
new
you can change the parrent in game settings if you dont wanna attack random enemies
10% damage per 1k gold
9 -> 7
havent changed desert enemies nope
you need 45
yeah but once you do more quests the slots open up
how many quests do you have?
you get more when you unlock enough quests
<:VedThumb:1420426915701067879>
i cant lmao
oh my god
because i am fucking swarmed with feedback and im trying to upload an update here üíÄ
yeah
yeah lol had me worried
idk i use smart aim because im used to it
yeah thats fine
oh lmao
smart aim target enemies in front of you
how? üëÄ
separate
uuh some other changes ill post in the full changelog update
fox got more base luck
athena also got buffed
and most characters are much faster
Yeah a few are changed, like ogre
we are testing it right now, and if no issues are find ill push this to public
but you need the beta version for that as well haha, it's not public yet
and then 45 and 55 for the 4th slots
25 and 35 quests
was changed from 12 -> 6 in this new update
just need 5-6 runs i believe
you can cheat all you want with leaderboard uploads turned off
the ridiculously high scores that dissapeared from the leaderbaord?
rankers?
yeah might happen in the future
it also made crit tome and cl4nks passive useless
yeah but there are other ways to scale with them, and having a single weapon that break the game and is NEEDED for a run is lame
Dice now only gives crit chance to the dice weapon. previously it gave global crit chance, which was a bug
it scales itself, but it was a bug that it scaled all other weapons
late game he gets less to prevent him from becoming way too overpowered in endgame
üíÄ
how did that happen??
wait what
yup
ill test it on steam deck ig
ü§è
:)
thatd be helpful
you should be able to get it on linux
alr if you restart steam and try the public beta now
nono it's just ui stuff, the chest price shows in HUD next to level
restart steam
yeah üëÄ
It's just an update to the game you can help me test early
Your progression is the same and will be fine :)
your progress?
what does that mean?
<:Bananarang:1354153135039578202>
i will do very bad things to you taeko
guys check <#1323666051866558565> if you wanna help me test the changes!!!
dont have a build for that yet hollup
:))
ill give you details in like 5min
guys im uploading a new version right now but i need help testing it
slowly but surely
soont here will be nothing left of the leaderbaords
miguel angell, you can find it on yt
who let richard cook
üíÄ
we can make that happen
so youre saying scorpionussy needs to be hot?
but thats a banger idea
okay now we're getting even more freaky than me
its literally a scorpion
WHAT
LOL
so something is probably wonky
might be bugged, it was previously using the stageTimer, when it should've used the runTimer
if i may say so myself xd
the white one goes hard af ngl
i think its disabled now
yeah it detects your username
yup
maybe tomorrow, need to finish up stuff and get it all tested
so in the next update the boss is driving around in a porsche with 100m hp?
<:VedThumb:1420426915701067879>
yeah the update making the boss easier is going well! its really fair now
everyone else is a poser
im a day 1 moldy cheese enjoyer and proud of it
thanks bro
guys i am happy to announce i will be reinstating googas in this server
yeah
this is the true answer
ill do a grand reset on it all when i have time <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
it's helt together by duct tape
i dont know either
youre never safe
hiding among the masses
ü¶Ä
googas gone
feedback stuff, bugs, etc
working on it rn
tech is to wait for next update for now :D
he returns them like a good lad after you beat him
but... you didnt get your weapons back?
how did you level up during a boss figh?
i agree tho i like playing ogre as long as you know hjow to bhop its totally fine
first time ive ever heard that
gg
i think is the main overview
it'll be changed to heal less from the regen phase, make the charge zones bigger, make his attacks deal less damage, blue orbs freeze you for less time, and give you one weapon back for each phase you clear
uuh gonna change some of that stuff, but for now the best tip is just to play someone with a strong primary weapon and level that up a ton
for now i just wanna finish this patch
so ill be rolling out more once i have time
but steam just allowesd me to upload more than 100 achievements
yeah theres still like 150 achievements in-game that are not on steam
wasnt very practical
it looked cool but
yeah or at least my implementation
it was originally but it sucked
yooo
holy blue bullets on cl4nk
*dont screenshot this for the future*
all thats planned for now is just free updates, dont think ill ever do anything else
naah we never adding anything like that <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
you guys have asked and you shall finally receive
guys i am happy to announce in our next update i will be adding a battlepass and loot crates you can open for only $9.99 with lots of skins
it works incrementally yeah
gonna nerf their damage a bit
if you get some beefy rings you can definitely go hp tome and get some daamge, but nothing crazy atm
yeah id love to but got lots of other things to fix first rn
He has a bug with his wepaon as well
Hes not meant to be this OP
Dicehead is gonna be nerfed :))
And that dlesnt work on linux?
Uuuuuuh
Oh you want more than 300
Just turn off vsync in settings
Have been all day
Im working on the next update :)
no problem
holy fuck those items
hoverboard guy, robinette, amog, noelle i think
hes the goat, so damn fast
there is also a setting to not upload to lb if you wanna play with cheats
<:kevin:1419298615955947645>
true tbh
*and ive been tired*
just havent been able to make an update yet, things have been busy
the kills are legit now, it's just that dicehead is kinda OP and bugged, but he will be nerfed soon
not it's in NA
i thought he was from italy
thanks! and that doesnt matyer, all support is appreciated :)
<3
mobility is also important to prioritize
as far as the final boss, you would need to actually get some movespeed items or shrines + extra jumps
movespeed will be buffed a little bit across all characters next update, as well as making some of the slower fuckers a little faster
Yeah i just dont want to learn ECS even though maybe the game would run a lot better with it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I think performance is good enough, dont need to many more enemies than what i have now
looking at the code it should work just fine, but idk if you can manually count them and prove it's counting wrong then come back to me ill take a second look lol
ill double check but i think they should count
ive made a few shitty games in the past but nothing of this scale
at least ive tried to get rid of most of them i could find
most raycasting / spherecasting is all just allocated, so there arent many ram / GC issues as far as i know
I havent had any issues with memory, it's mostly processing power from physics that's the bottleneck
Nah it's all just default Unity stuff, no ECS
looool
<3
yeah ive just muted the channel, did the trick for me
yeah i mean theres just so many things to do atm
i guess
Not yet, but Luck gives you better upgrades and chests, armor is just straight up flat reduction, but it doesnt scale linearly, and bloodmark are stacks that yuo apply on enemies that scale damage with your level, once you have enough stacks the enemies explode
so if you see in your stats that you have a 2x crit multiplier, then that means you actually have 4x damage when yuo crit
the one you see in yuor stats is another multiplier added on top
the default crit multiplier is 2
gonna fix in the next update but yeah
it shouldnt
we can probably get that done eventually
thank you sock
my goat
tomorrow we start cooking megabonk update fr
im going to bed gn
and seeing as we are on overwhelmingly positive rn, thatd be a bad idea
it's not really recommended to patch your game right after launch, as you reviews will be split into recent and all time
havent had time yet
newfrogs wont know that moldy cheese was once the most hated item in megabonk existence
idk
uuh there is a total of like 248 i think, theres some hidden stuff ig
theyre all really good tbh
stacks like poison but doesnt tick, and then enemy explodes when you have built enough damage
but yeah lots to do rn <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
like map, character, etc
ill add some filters eventually
just per player
my god
jesus theres 124k leaderboard entries
always
gnight
overheal
yes, coming next week
it looks very empty in 5 minutes
yes but ill bring back flames since people want flames even if they clutter the screen gg
classic
yeah
idk how to make thorns viable
Quin is cooked
if he grabs more lifesteal and gold tomes im going to be very angry
yeah uuh i think you click above the banner where it sayd Megabonk and then you can get it? im not sure
damn you guys are cooking for me
youre the maaaannnn
Thanks goat
you better hurry
Haha no i did account for that
sure yeah
and also his dice is bugged and gives crit chance to his entire character, not his weapon only
yeah something around there
which is fucking insane
currently he gets like 50% of a charge shrine everytime he levels up which is kinda ridiculous
thats boring
dicehead is currently not a challenge AND is completely dominating the leaderbaords
yes but there should still be a challenge
i always thought it looked weird but then i tried it and it was so much fun
the gameplay never did it justice to how fun it is lol
bought i last year and played a bit
i think i have 10 hours on it or smth
letsgo john megabonk
it's an item in the shop in the main menu
absolutely, he also has a donation link in description
no >=)
well you could also just buy the toggler which does exactly this
hello
probabyl a hidden map for the real gamers
to match the demo gameplay
ill make an "original" demo map / mode
yeah
dm me rq?
(you can do that if you bunny hop and hit it at an angle)
thanks for checking it out :)
idk right now i just wanna fix my game up lmao
hmm not a bad idea, should look into that
beast
so it's a bit less gated behind bhopping
im gonna boost the movement speed next week
we do a little trolling
"Roger that" or like Roger the name?
wait what lol
one of my fav but i also like getting destroyed
Thanks :D
oh
can probably just make a toggle in settings
1 2 and 3 will select stuff in upgrade menu yeah
Yeah but ti already is like that, Athena has 100% block with Aegis
she doesnt
and with some luck as well youd get so many good upgrades
that sounds insane
oh my god
WHY IS HE ON TOP OF THERE
HAHA
zoom around and find him
try playing monke of calcium
yep wrench isnt very good in tier1
p2p lmao
true
absolute lunatic
I was watching Lirik play and he called the wrench dogshit
finally someone who gets the wrench
and you need a good item to microwave to use it
theyre a bit rare tho
microwaves
balancing for now, need to fix all the issue people are having too
both
thanks bro
i have recovered from launch
update next week sometime
definitely will be working on this
and a weekly one will be on the front page
im gonna make an all time section of the leaderboard as well i think
it will only remove existing scores
it should still count yeah
but we do NOT speak about taht
there is another forbidden way of cancelling fall damage
we can probably get that going at some point
dude i am a big fan
oh my god
guys we are front page
try changing your localization setting. still nothing?
Sounds very weird
this would be game breaking stuff
gonna need a to see a clip
can you stop fall damage by hugging walls
<:kevin:1419298615955947645>
wait what?
thank you dudigaming
no
yo
lemme fix
man whys kevin sop low quality
<:Kevin:1419297991201656842>
shes my queen
ik right
thats fucking sick
holy shit you did it
is my guess
yeah i think it's a bug where the silver timer keeps running in the menu, then hits the cap at which point it gives you a silver, so you get silver from the first kill
just pick up a fuckton of chests
havent tried but i think you can go turbo challenge on tier1, grab a silver tome, and go to town
your english is great :)
as megachad i believe
i got incredibly lucky and got a campire when an enemy pushed me into a chest <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
maybe a legendary item that allows you to choose on passive or smth
a better solution i've thought of is maybe allowing you to obtain other characters passive, but thatd also be very OP
that would kinda ruin the point of characters tho right? idk
the goat
it's for the sniper and shotgun weapons
*none*
maybe exclusive 1 and 2
might be too strong stage 3
idk how it would play
I might make a shrine or something, where you can banish your tome, get 50% of the stats from it permanently, and then being able to choose a new tome?
*and i didnt even mean to do this*
sounds like the ror2 crabs all over again
true but also it's kinda funny to have that one quest everyone hates
didnt mean for it to be so fucked
havent tried the challenge so i wouldnt know :DDDD
might be better to become a lot stronger and kill them more easily later game
sure if you can get enough thorns / lifesteal in that short amount of time
then that enemy spawns exclusively for 30s, after which the entire pool is used
picks a new random enemy every minute unless there is a swarm or boss
not sure of the use case here tho
i think he wants to take a tome / weapon, get some upgrades, and then banish?
already in the works :)
cant you already banish obtained items? or do to you mean weapons or tiomes
ive seen someone do it with ghosts tho (bob)
thorns was my first thought too but i never managed to make it work
rip
oh okay
also megachad can use flex to get some kills early which is nice ig
Athena has build in thorns so maybe thats the play?
my bad
yea
chunkers
and for example flamewalker, axes, etc
not for sword, but for a lot of projectiles it does
it's out of hand <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
man i love that theres so many stupid items you can use that i never thought of
never thought of that
thats genius
wtf
holy shit
you've done pacifist?
working on megabonk atm
got so many dms rn i cant really check üíÄ
but they accepted me now :)
yeah, but you need steam to "accept" you to add more than 100 achievements and they dont tell you how you are accepted
yeah for sure, i wanna add a lot more stuff :)
shows red arrow to boss
minimap
damn uuh did you check the minimap? was there not a boss arrow there?
üëÄ
something im gonna add in next update tho, idk how you have the update early when i havent even made it yet
thats kinda funny but definitely not intended
lmao no
<:Monke:1417923321168662720>
how do you have aegis and chonkes in the final fight?
but its kinda shit
idk the intention of the weapon was that it would attach and then you use the string to kill things between yuo and the attached enemy
clip of almost blasting the final boss
ill search it up
man
what
:spoiler:
test
unc status achieved
OH
lol
:_spoiler
uh
_spoiler
test
no, but attack speed works
I'll put a spoiler tag on it but idk how to do that
wait was my clip spoiling final stage, maybe should remove that
oops
due to robinettes passive
has 1000x damage multiplier
beat it for the first time yesterday, but i was also on an INSANE run
very few
i've written it down, ill bring back some of the carpte bombing üíÄ
üíÄ
good point
But once it gets bigger it just covers the entire screen
True, i can look into at least having it there as long as it's not too big
So i had to nerf them a bit
the particle effects were so big you couldnt see anything on the screen üòÜ
SHE MEGA ON MY BONK TIL I OOFIE
Shrine of the missclicker
Shrine of skill issue
Shrine of mistakes
maybe i can add a shrine or smth idk
oooh is that what yuo mean? like remove it from your inventory completely?
ill make him give back one weapon for every phase
yeah but im gonna change it a bit
bruh
oh, i mean you can banish things
2.5% per purchase
takes you back to 3 tomes
well you just go to the shop, extra tomes, and refun yuor purchase
you already can
max is 99%
there is no overdodge, the graph is not linear, so you can never hit 100%
that could be fun
4 is also a bit much but it works
5 is just... lame i think
2-3 is a much better balance imo
you can just go for a generic ass build that has everything every time
more tomes = less builds
if it was up to me (wait it is up to me) there would only me max 3
nah im not really a fan of many tome slots
but it'll be a while til the update, like maybe early next week idk, got lots of things to fix
im gonna change the weapons and tomes requirements to 25 and 35 i think
3 i thinjk
D:
kinda weird
sure, i just need to buy a mac or something, i apparently cant build my game without a mac lol
i think ill put them into a secret map or something
thanks for hanging out and palying the bonk guys
anyway im gonna work on some feedback and maybe some content idk
he absolutely is lol
not a bad idea
that actually works and isnt copyrighted
bonkachu?
Thur LOL
doesnt exist yet, got any ideas?
youre a beast
Hahaha :D
someone apparently said theyd gift you tho
my bad bro will nerf
poor potato
damn stop roasting the poor man for wanting the game for free
debatable
damn not sure why its not showing
try not to die of sleep deprevation at least
holy
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
we advice against it
ooho with the thorns, not a bad idea
search up steam recording, very easy to use
ive seen a few
Just go calcium on turbo, take a lot of chests and grab silver and quantity tome or damage tome
you can farm that pretty hard
probably silver tome on a Turbo challenge
yeah he needs a boost
gonna make all slow characters faster
not gonna destroy him but its boring if leaderboards is just dicehead
hes a bit too easy to play rn unfortunately
LOL
thas the plan :)
she mega on my bonk
??
ü•Ä
yeah his passive is also getting a nerf because its insane
so yuo basically dont need crit tome, just get a dice instead üíÄ
instead of giving crit chance to the dice weapon, it gives crit chance to your character (all your weapons and other hits)
it's a bit broken rn due to a bug
you can just hover over the enemies
if you unlock birdo, try him with flamewalker and some extra jumps
such a fun build
so can probably cheese some quests
yeah all qeusts are always active
need to fix a ton of shit
idk maybe sunday / monday / tuesday idkdikd
im gonna lower the requirement in next update
50 and 60 quests
So we're getting all 250 achievements and other shit
:DDD
WE JUST DID
and you should be golden
just go damage tome and like quantity tome, and add another nice weapon
you need to do it as CL4nk
you just leave
or Contact
bro you just quit at that point
üó£Ô∏è üó£Ô∏è im diamond 4 in megabonk, 2100 elo
RANKED MEGABONK
queue up with your homie and survive the longest
versus mode i think would be fun af
nah we start working on Gigabonk now
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
massive impostor syndrome ig
and very grateful for the response
like death
Thoughts on making weapons and tomes available at like 25 and 35 quests respectively?
yeah the curses cant stack on a single target
have no idea how it is against final boss tbh
if youre lucky enough for it to curse a boss taht is
its really strong on bosses from what ive found
jk <3
:D
i like it :)
id say its pretty good
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
only athena can completely avoid damage with the aegis
go into unlocks and toggle on or off bought items
you take a tiny amount of damage
yeah they dont make you invulnerable anymore
thanks
so much mobility
calcium also kinda easy mode now imo
well it would be kinda lame if you got a rare upgrade but it was just +1 projectile just like common
Aegis also has a "hidden" buff that makes thorns damage stack on top of it
yeah sure, if you take damage you retaliate with your thorns damage
You can hover stats when you get an upgrade, but it's not currently workign in the pause menu
yeah jonny
oh right, i havent added that yet, but i wanna do it tho
damage is always nice, maybe cooldown as well or just quantity
press pause, look right
hello dsf
OR messing with graphics settings, im not quite sure what could be causing it
hmm try turning off vsync and setting max fps to like 120 or something
yeah
it's 2.5%
the silver?
Okay thanks for the info!
It really is
the 2nd one can still trigger, hence the name overpowered lamp :D
yeah for things like moldy cheese, gloves, or other on hit effect items
steam or game achievement?
you unlocked him with only 3 challenges?
it's mostly il2cpp rn to protect people from yoinking my game and putting it on mobile stores and stuff, though that will happen eventually anyway i guess
what do games usually do? like risk of rain 2? is that mono?
dm me a link :)
appreciate that
thank you beast!!
uuuh when i get to it, im still recovering <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
yeah it's fixed
gonna add it yeah
noo thank you for playing man!!
it's 2.5% increase per purchase i believe
im gonna put it in the shop eventually, i just forgot
it shows up there
when you spawn in, pause the game, and check your shrine log
how old is your pc?
im working on a fix, it's due to old computers not being able to handle the shaders
are they pink by chance?
üíÄ
kevin is your frined
i was so close
I ALMOST one shot the boss
:D
but i got 2nd place :DDD
little bug
can confirm robinette is S tier
so close to wr
LOL
had a crazy run
LETSGOO
already on the list! not sure ill be able to add crazy skate mechanics
i think im cooking
keep talking and see what happens
and i think he already made a video but its locked
yeah sent him a key, he said he might play :)
check the General tab in quests
you need to complete more quests
basically constantly negative to anything anyone said
nah he was a lot worse
i wonder what googas would say if he was here now ü•Ä
he's basically cutting time in half somehow
usually takes 40min
thats actually absurd
this guy megas his bonk
to the final boss on t3 and defeating him
that is 24 minutes
im pissed
wtf?
the fuck
how
<@305847738493304832> bro?
bro what
i saw nothing
what did mosin ask lol
tier 3 is significantly harder
WHY ARE WE SHOUTING
Miguel Angell, he cooked with it fr
appreciate it though
no but if you wanna support more you can gift copies of the game to friends or people who cant afford it :))
But I *think* a better solution is shooting 50% of the projectiles at the closest enemy? I will have to test this a bit
shooting all your proecjtiels in one direction and then getting smacked from behind
this is to prevent getting fucked in swarms
then it will target random ones or use smart targeting
basically your first projectile will always hit the closest enemy
you're right, i does work in a bit of a weird way but the intenton was good lol
sick skin
thank you king! appreciate that!!
he was the man to destroy the demo
i will execute him
son of a bitch is gonna tank my sales
‚ù§Ô∏è
byebye dying light üëø
holy shit
thanks monke :D
:DDDDDDD
we're probably gonna get it tho
yeah they auto pop, and the requirements arent described so nobody knows
omg he's literally HIM

it's zesty megachad
I have the perfect megabonk skin for you my friend

yeah, i think 3 is enough tbh
well you have to unlock it first
yeah 4 weps and 4 tomes
reminds me of old games
like climbing over the map border is fun af
i love bugs that dont ruin the game
surely no bugs <:Clueless:937817066491248682>
love me some ror2
thank you king

its not that sick, im on 2 hours of sleep and not enough time :DDDD
THANK YOU
<@1270017428994261053> <@762670142022352906> thanks for the boosts goats üëë
yeah
8pm cest
sorry im baiting spoilers
oh wait you might be right
if u have 4 weapons and collect katana and shotgun and banana and luck tome will you have 7 weapons and 5 tomes?
i think the max is like 10k
...
$8.50 on launch
got way too many bugs to fix
got enough testers :)))
hehe
doesnt give you anything tho
just alows the server to have a custome link and some other stuff
or broette
thanks bro
YO
thanks clippy! stay epic
$10, 8.50 on launch
we're cooked
pretty sure they already did yeah
R$32.99, and then theres a 15% discount on launch
im sure some people will appreciate that
i just wanna keep it up for nostalgia tbh
prolly not
demo is kinda bricked for controller :/ I've fixed it in the new version, but havent had time to fix the demo yet.
oficially 95%
you heard it here first
there you go
are we 95%
nah like how finished is megabonk
how finished would you say it is taco?
music is mostly done, and i dont have to do much in that department anyway
trailer tomorrow probably, press kit is easy
im finishing menu now
id say 95% is fair yeah
yeeah cant believe we got it right before launch as well, so lucky :D
114k ü§Ø
thank you!!
it will be $10 and 8.50 on launch
thanks!"
they do i was just checking the values cuz they might sometimes be weird
okay thanks for the help!
yeah they should be cheaper due to regional pricing so it's about 50% off
it's $10 in US, do you think 429 russian ruble is a fair price?
i was just looking at the pricing
yeah!
idk rpobabyl not, at least for now im focusing on the pc version
THANKS :)
i didnt make that
yeah but the music is outsourced tho
lmfao
you kinda cooked with rank 842
lool niceee
and glad to hear it, i hope it runs well on your potato
your english is very good!
hello biggyjon
letsgoo gl bro
thanks king
blame tacoDragon, he made it
lmaooo
Yeah
havent contacted any press or content creator, but i was lucky to have some big creators (like dex) ferature my game!
That in combination with the demo probably did the heavy lifting
Posted on reddit, tiktok and youtube, and had some videos blow up
gigabonk is coming out next year same time obviously
I was in the next fest in Match i believe it was, and that really boosted my wishlists to i think around 50k ü§Ø
but im super blessed to have like 100k+ wishlists, thats absolutely insane, and i feel bad saying it's "small" in my videos lol, but it helps build a lot of hype and drive wishlists
i very much realize, it's more just a marketing tactic i use to make me seem like the tiny underdog vs these giant AAA games
<@601140715657101322> THANKS :D
goat
thats fucking insane
wtf bro is hiking in his wildest DRIP
yessir thank you
cant say i have
cookin bugs
ill get to it im jsut a bit busy atm
yeah will set it up closer to launch
<@182110722384199680> thank youuu
or maybe check <#1344712310589100074> first
shoot
there will be regional pricing
hey everyone :))
damn the short hit like crazy
gg
solid bench
damn bro
maybe if i really grind
idk if ill ever be able to 100% the game
you've got a lot to check off the list then
thank you :)
lmaoo
but no microtransactions xD
for in-game money
you can buy a ton of stuff
no pay to win
no haha
solomio
yep solo dolo
thank you :D
or around 8.50 with launch discount i think
nope sorry, $10
üêí
just jump on a wall, do a little wallrun and jump again
so you can basically almot wallhop
he can wallrun
it's just me here hahah but ive added monke
*which is why the final swarm can be lag city*
but it's not a problem unless the enemies move fast
or rather the physics
yeah that is the main bottleneck
ive done a lot to optimize it though so hopefully it would work
yeah, would be cool, performance should be fine i think but id have to test
maybe? i think porting it can be a bit time consuming though, i also dont know anythig about it
true
and id prioritize multiplayer first tbh
and i mean im all for it, i just have a feeling thats quite a lot of work
yeah i think the problem is i have to create an API for modders to use if my game is IL2CPP
even if my game is IL2CPP?
since thats just models and textures
if anything, it shouldn't be too hard to add basic modding like custom chaarcters
agreed
idk shit about modding
maybe? also something i will look into after launch
it's more adjusted in the full game tho! keeps the intensity all the wat
yeah well i think it's fine but when you get to 6-9 minutes its honestly too easy and barely any enemies spawn
yep, enemies would need a lot more hp
im a sucker for multiplayer games tho so im all for it
ill have to figure out how hard it is to add tho, might be chill or might be completely fucked
nah but i really wanna add it, so ill consider it after launch
its like 700k views in under 24h thats crazzyyyyy
damn tiktok has been doing work
on tiktok?
siiick thank you!
sup
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
thats insane
final stretch holy shit
what is a dingoes
even though i found it funny as fuck
id di actually fix that
oh
thanks... :D
glad to hear it! thanks for feedback
should work totally fine in full game tho, as i am using a new and improved system
sorry about that, the demo is using an old input system and it sucks
never
wtf is vertix fishbowl
hes like my evil twin or something?
im not sure tbh
during the demo they were crazy active
i wonder if the vcs are gonna pop
thanks g :D glad you like it
increasing with like 500-1000 every hour, we're getting 100k today for sure!!
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
one of the best items in the game <:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
especialyl if you get an Anvil my god
*now it's vastly overpowered* :D
and the axe ig does it in the demo
for example the bow has been changed in the full game to shoot all its projectiles at the same time
Nah, but some weapons do
so you might be good without wifi
300mb i think
the game barely uses wifi tho, so yuo should be fine, and the game is only like
just dm me, ill remember
and you're an OG
i can probably get you a key, i requested some keys from steam to giveaway to my bois who couldnt get it for different reasons
cant use steam in your country?
wdym?
tends to happen when youre chronically online, all my friends and people my age generally speak very well english i feel like
i respect it
thats not king status thats just beggar status
üëë you dropped this
okay im actually gonna go focus so we can playtest lmao
üêê
we're both unc
im a boomer too bro dw
back off
stay away old man
dont go there
my childhood
<@187342982133972992> firered and leafgreen
the 100k dream BABY
apparently it's 96k now, the new video is doing WORK
then we'll see what happens after that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
would be sick af but currently im only focused on finishing and launching the pc version
thanks g glad you like it!
so that might help
yeah i literally just today claimed the /megabonk discord link
oh interesting
<:OmegaOmegachad:1400119344138031227>
oh okay lol
im not really sure how i can get it to show there tbh, prolly need to get it indexed somehow
also did you try to search up the discord on google and couldnt find it?
yeeah thats fixed in the full game
might make a dedicated channel for it
i dont think you can use it tho befcause it makes these huge embedds
probably a bit if your computer is lower end, i havent noticed anything tho
god damn its so nice lol
you can get an instant replay
you literally see it when you press shift+tab to open the game overlay
dwjust search a youtube tutorial, its super fast and easy
id highly recommend it
you can choose, from my experience its great quality
or characters, challenges or maps
also integrated with megabonk so you can see timelines for swarms, deaths, etc
auto records last hour, small file size, integrated in steam
its really fucking nice
just use steam game recording
but hey thats what we got playtesting for ig, surely later today
idk maybe im overthinking it
but then itsnt the real problem that the tomes are unbalanced, if knockback is good on aura but you still wont pick it?
yeeh true! thatd be kinda sick for an item actually
cuz with 6 tomes you will literally always just go luck, difficulty, damage, cooldown, crit
Yeah i see where youre coming from, i just feel like if you can have all those tomes it ruins the concepts of builds
i *think* 5 might be too many
instead of being able to just get every tome yk
im not even sure if 5 tomes is too OP, im kind of a fan of limiting it a litle bit so you have to go for a specific build
oh yeah thats true as well
yeah i agree
i always thought projectile speed tome was garbage but there is a new weapon where it's really good
definitely something i wanna add down the line tho
hmm no but i was gonna add something like that i just never did <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
hes cheating
goated pfp but mega sus actor
was about to say
we're all oofie fans in here
we are locked in
not capping this time
maybe
but yeah its real
18 september
hey!
uh oh
the 100k dream is real
dude the new short cooked, we are at 95k wishlists...
yeah ai is getting pretty convincing these days yk
these ai generated posts are getting annoying fr
another fake screenshot
<:Aga:1345906998369189890>
very good
debatable
sounds familiar, didnt he play it a few days ago?
his name?
but the game isnt quite done yet so cant really do it yet <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
i think so
yeah
3
yeah sorry the door is closed
*to hell*
welcome people üëã
okay i am weak too
?mute <@300487110438289409> 1s
you guys just dont have the same power as me
noo whats that
uh oh
*probably*
tomorrow....
i have no more time to add new content tbh <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
i feel like that's the reaction of all the youtubers who play it loool
but now it feels balanced again
was supper worried like 1-2 weeks ago because it wasnt very fun to play, id only added content and not tested enough
just finished another test session and man it's actually coming together
hes cooking up some BANGERS
Miguel Angell, a dude i found on fiverr
gonna send him a key and test my luck ig
he said he will play on launch, i hope he remembers :DDD
the perfect clickbait
sure dms are always open
or along the way
it's not really hard to fix up, so doing that last
uuh it's in progress, small things here and there (main menu)
it's all polishing rn
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>  naah we'll be fine i think
but generally speaking, 2 weeks out from launch seems to be the point of no return
well i heard from reddit so its not the most credible source <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
i've heard you *technically* can if you message support and have a really good reason, but they usually wont let you
i had to limit the max amount you can stack because it was so strong and made the game lag <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
theres a reason they call it overpowered
etc
spicy meatball can explode twice
so cheese can poison twice
anything with on hit effects gets an extra roll to proc their on hit effects
aready in, it shows up after 2 hours in the final swarm
how do you know?
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
technically im working
Im playtesting
just had a god run and got fucked by the boss im fuming
my goat <3
she megaing on my bonk until i bust
they cant handle the bonk
damn this must be it
ooof
we're so cooked
otherwise i would :D
i cant move it anymore, it's locked id D:
guys im delaying megabonk until next year
just a bit annoying that they moved their date <:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
i dont know anything about it tbh, so im not sure
Nah hopefully not
first silksong cooks me and now this
dying light the beast literally just moved their release date to sep 18 instead of the original sep 19 üíÄ
bro i swear
And im feeling triggerhappy
Ragebaiting someone and posted art with a slur in it
the final boss of gooning
thats pretty hype
honestly i respect it
jorkin with one hand and fighting with the other
naaaah üíÄ
üåΩ corn?
wtf is the korn incident
lmfao
$90 here
borderlands is like
also speaking of prices
that is if you are finished with borderlands 4
dont worry you have a whole day to play megabonk before dying light the beast releases and overshadows me
unacceptable
im so cooked
SHUT UP
yeah ill have to review every price with my financial advisor (chatgpt)
yeh ig people change their region for better prices
üôè
you saved me bro
lmaoooo thats crazy
i think their autopricing is fucked
in argentina or smth its like $0.1
well glad you brought this up, i was about to get cooked by steam
Okay, steam auto pricing apparently set it to $1 LOL so im gonna have to adjust it a bit manually
so thats helpful
yeah im wondering more what people would find acceptable yk
Lmao appreciate that but i dont wanna make it too expensive for your region either way
and what's too expensive?
so what do you think a fair price is for a game like this?
<@804646685967384587> aight thanks, looks like the turkish prices range from like 40%-80% off US prices
how much is peak?
repo i think
uuh
damn if silksong is using auto prices like me then megabonk will be like 3.50
okay well i am using steam auto regional prices so it should be adjusted
lol dudi calling him out üíÄ
whats your currency?
regional prices
ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è  it's actually 120
but dont worry, surreeely we will playtest soon (i swear)
which means technically i can just update the game and replace it with a virus, but maybe they have checks in place for that (they probably do)
they only need to verify you once
oh nah dont worry they dont check updates
thanks roger, even tuned down the color saturation all for you
i sure hope no sicko with discord light mode comes along and takes a picture
also ignore thats it's in thai <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
Okay probably going with this, feels a lot smoother
bruh
*ill add an option to toggle probably but i still need to know which one to default to*
Chat which one do we prefer?
üáµüá±
and tons of tiny polish everywhere
testing, a lot of testing üíÄ
tiny
lol
sounds cool yeah
you'll have to fight the calcium enjoyers, they're already willing to die on that hill
thank youu! im excited too but kinda scared, i hope people like it lol
<:Cl4nk:1353679518459498537>
based clanker
<@300487110438289409> THANKSSS
üíÄ
Then once you have some experience it's a bit easier to start working on a bigger project you know
Hmm probably a bit hard, id suggest starting with some smaller projects first to get into making games first
yeah let's go we just need 100m more wishlists to get there
<@1270017428994261053> yooo thanks
No it's just perell dont worry about ut
Oh yeah the bot was murdered
Oh ok yeah i think i see it
What where?
Roguelite is a roguelike but with permanent upgrades ig
Also roguelite cardbuilder open world mmo
thanks goat
hes pretty cracked
damn thats weird
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
thats enough for me to go discord
yeah its just a few seconds
now im just chatting in discord every time it compiles üíÄ
it's getting longer and longer the bigger the project
man tell me about it
Unity is pretty easy, but so is Godot so idk
Lmao
Damn its in 1 week im cooked
Nope sorry, you'll have to wait until next week :o
/delete all
how do i unsee something
delete this
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
havent figured out all the legal stuff yet but thats the plan
and then ill flip a switch and it blows up everyones computers
im gonna make the torren for my own game available and get everyone to download it
youd have to torrent to get it tho
a hater pack would be kinda cool
literally never said that
whats stopping someone from pausing the game and just spamming text files in there
yeppp
thats actually a fucking terrible idea LOL
thats actually a fucking sick idea LOL
No but Richard bought Hollow Knight, he is trying to be a trendy gamer you see
*but soon it will be tho* :o
it's not public
such a based playstyle
no shot
but nt
istg it's like day 11 max
we'll do some closed testing soon yeah, just gotta fix some stuff
spitting fax
not false üíÄ  was tryna get playtesting started last week but theres so many tiny things i need to finish
<@238602390968860672> thanks goat and uh idk about livestream maybe ill try to get one of those steam streams up
it's still like 69 i think, just doing a fuckton of balancing, music, mainmneu, all sorts of tiny things
thank you :D
official lore letsgo
thats cannon now
calcium only learned to kickflip
unfortuantely not :(
i cant lie?
icl?
man ya'll got new words every day
*and thats a lot of work*
not false but that would require an entire remodel and not just a skin
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
how do you know i havent already added a hidden googas png
no
too busy chatting in megabonk discord
well it'll have to be after megabonk launch, aint got time to check it out rn
bet
free on steam?
glad you like it bro, and ill check it out
pimpest wheelchair
but i bet it exists
probably mad expensive to get a wheelchair with a dope ass suspension system
ah okey letsgo
are you in US by chance?
that sucks, didnt know wheelchairs were so expensive
yeah :/
or i didnt consider you could reset for them ig
just didnt think it was gonna be a problem when i first added it
balance shrines are way too unbalanced, i dont want people who go for highscores to depends on good resets üíÄ
yes they will be removed lmao
gn
i gotchu
oh okay thats a whole other story then
isnt it like $20
*dies of allergy*
bruh <:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
this is high treason
im taking away your delete perms
what the fuck
Damn lmao and idk, havent got it checked out, i just know i get fucked around cats
maybe some shrimp would do
whats your currency?
should be region adjusted prices but idk
im allergic to cats tho
üó£Ô∏è OKAY MY FRIEND SPECIAL DEAL FOR YOU
crazy to assume i dont miss a single message
uh what was it?
its only $10 but we can make a special deal for you at $100, no problem <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
uuuh im not sure what the discount is yet, steam recommends like 15%
so its a lot easier
i think it is to complete map 1 tier 1
great question
uuh
it wouldnt make sense
thats why progress doesnt carry over, a lot of things are different
cl4nk achievement is different in full game
üóø
Nope sorry
*it does not*
85k :o
on aegis is adds your thorns damage on the aegis damage
uuh i cant remember if it works on shield but im pretty sure
glad to hear it toby
cook or get cooked
damn the pressure is on ig
not at launch, i really wanna add it tho but we'll see, ill have to look into it after
thank you! <3
only fam and friends atm anyway
no sorry :)
they dont show up anymore, so you can get more of the items you want
i love welcome messages LETSGO
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
well you know one now
did you forget the 4th commandment
yet lol
im gonna clog something else if you dont stop complaining
why do people hate welcome messages so much?
I will never ü¶π
üëã
fuck is it only 12 days
uuh maybe eventually? but first ill focus on pc version :)
yeah you can find it on the steam page, though im not sending out review keys yet
got a lot to do atm, so it's not a priority :s
maybe, ill try to get it set up a bit after launch
i have so much more i wanna add still
there will be updates yep yep
thats messed up richard
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
yeah i agree with perell here to be honest
Lmao nice
get in queue pal
i think it was a good decision to delay the bonk ngl
Wait lol it actually crasehd
LOL
xD
watch out zed!!
but a gay skin for everyone would be nice tho
they dont all have the same skins
Nah they also have 5, the rainbow skins are part of their 5 skins
but adding a rainbow skin to every character would be 20 more skins yeah üíÄ
these are just skins i already had in the game
oooh nah i mean adding a "super" skin or whatever you guys called it to every character
of course it's added
it's literally the goat calcium skin it's cannon
wdym not being added???
i probably havent shown all
Ill increase you pay with 5 bananarangs a month <:Bananarang:1354153135039578202>
Gj vbrvababxy
Bur we need more mod abuse around here
Idk what i just came back to
Sad fun fact: had to change the name Rollerblades because that is a copyrighted thing
even me
True, wont even have to do taxes cuz we're all pirating it
Cant be bothered reading all the text i just see numbers
Naah when i check on wikipedia it says a lot of countries are 50% or maybe im cooked
Don't most countries take 50% taxes or is that just a Norway thing?
I think Steam takes 30% right and then half of whats left goes to taxes oouf
Damn why you gotta do me like that
It really is
Yessir
chat is cooked again
<:OmegaAga:1400120744834502768>
hes googas fr
beefy ring is scaling off your base damage by adding a percentage. So if you deal 100 damage, and have 100% damage from beefy rings, that's 200 damage. The Damage tome does multiplicative damage, so if you have 2x from damage tome, that 200 damage turns into 400
max is like 99%
yeah
Noooooo
maybe will have to look into it after launch i think
megaeing my bonk so hard
oh shit it's releasing in 2 days right? dammnnnn
holy shit hey john megabonk
yeah runs totally fine, only the leaderoards dont work, but yeah thats to be expected
üóø
or i think so lemme check
yes works fine on deck offline
no im the vedinad guy
thanks :))
your friend is the goat
i take back everything i said tiktok > youtube
so the tiktok views arent worth as many wishlists as a youtube view
most of them are mobile gamers
yeah but tiktok isnt as good
soon we're passing silksong for sure
its definitely very good for wishlists
the newest one popped off tho
yeah insaneee
79k! we're fucking cooking
lets not talk about the naked guy in youtube short #14
there is another new one tho
nah hes right it's the new combat shrine lol
yeah edited my file, gotta get that optimized items pool hehe
337k, so im in like 12th place or smth
uuh lemme check
im megaing my bonk as we speak tbh
double the mega double the bonk
dont worry <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
it's just another channel i made to experiment with some stuff
<@367968582027706369> thanks goat
Hello wackass the first
it's 100x easier to implement than co-op (i wanna do co-op too), and sounds like a lot of fun tbh
something like that
and the one that dies first loses
then possibly you can do certain things to make it harder for the other player, like tetris versus lol
basically you load up with a friend on the same seed, and then you play on your own worlds with your own enemies, but you can see eachother as ghosts
we've talked a bit about a versus mode here and i think it would be a banger
hes natty
Mustaf you always cook with your ideas
yeah it's kinda messed up atm...
oh fuck might fit better
true thats a valid point
Overcrit, basocally crits on your crits
Damn sorry about that, the demo is using an old input system so its pretty buggy, but the full version has a new one so at least there it shouldnt be a problem
<@794283460046618680> do you have any controllers plugged in? That can cause it
üóø
yeah
just a random thought
and then you could put vampires in the name and not have any vampires in the game or something haha
wouldve probably been really popular
if only someone had made a game like that already
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
but im thinking of creating a "hidden" skate map for it
theres not even rails in the main game because i never figured out where / how to place them
99k before launch would be a sick goal tho
uh oh
great idea perell as always
100k before launch would be a sick goal tho
yoo?? thatd be so random ü§£
according to steamcharts, so thats pretty cool
naah but in a week we've gone from 65k to 75k, we're now in top 600 i think
üóø
but i wanna mostly finish the game first
probably will do some testing with some of the OGs in the community tho
nah only friends and family have access atm
probably that tbh
or maybe i just have a severe case of skill issue
hand him the final boss he wont be calling that easy
üò†
so based
yeeh thats the philosophy of the game right now, just gotta make sure not to make it too hard lol
might give it some more attempts late, gotta fix some bugs n stuff
its pretty fun but god damn hard
i was super low on time so it would have been extremely stressful so right now im hoenstly kinda glad it released hehe
cant really argue with that
you make a good point
but we have sir chadwell too now
based sir oofie enjoyer
pretty good, just been testing them out and fixing bugs and balancing mostly
In Subtance Painter with the Pixel8r plugin
eat some strawberry cheesecake
damn have a nice day
so weird lol
roblox just straight up banning the guy taking down preds
oh yeah i saw that stuff
‚ò†Ô∏è
googas is screwed
nice, then i will have monopoly on keys
i think so at least
youd have to get them from the dev?
you cant buy steam keys from steam anymore right?
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
üíÄ
but apparently it's bad doing too much lol
ill probably do 15% or more
i cant join the sale because my game is releasing too close to the sale :(
isnt there a sale in about a month
oof
how much is it?
oh didnt know they changed it damn
family share is goated
mgiht have to give it a try to see what the hype is all about
i have it in my library but never tried it
fair enough, not for everyone ig
uuh idk i hope they work
have you played hollow knight googas
but fuckit we ball
No
Player
Never heard of that before, so im not quite sure. Heres what you can do tho:
1. Start the game, get to mid run and make sure it crashes
2. **Don't restart the game**
3. Go to your Appdata and find the logfile:
```C:\Users\YourUserNameHere\AppData\LocalLow\Vedinad\Megabonk Demo```
Replace YourUserNameHere with your windows username.
4. Find the Player.log file, and send it to me in DMs
Yeeh its really wack..
?warn <@343692213445984259> please no w word in general
nice one perell
thats a clever comeback
i preffffer fleetwood min haha
fleetwood mac is the goat

hopefully i can finish everything in time lol
thank yoou, gonna be fun to release

ü´°
The goat
no problem
<@260242726061080576>
D:
üõå
im going to sleep cya
roger! >=(
sure :)
bro got that corporate rizz
ü§®
its just me here, no team <:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
sup
im gonna keep megabonking my schlong and there is NOTHING you can do to stop me
yeah yuo wish
and they say art is dead
damn thats actually a banger
lets hear it
maybe, will have to see how it impacts gameplay
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
ty
is that a streamer?
where wiki
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
I do like it but i already have an item that does the exact same thing ü§î
does it just ban enemeis from existence?
shady guys are not
moais are affected by luck
thats messed up xd
holy shit it's john megabonk
There's 85 achievements just for skins lmao
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
cant wait for megabonk 2 honestly
Bro if I did actual 5 different models per character it would take so long hooolyyy
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
if only... well we can keep on dreaming
rainbow calcium is the goat tho it's not even close
yeah what he said
uuh hollup
oh
yeah
something from one piece?
i dont even know what this omega thing is
but thats another extra skin for every character = another extra achievement üíÄ
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
wait it kinda goes hard
üëã
ok imma go finish these damn skins
but here you can go for 30min and it gets a bit boring nuking everyhing <:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
its not quite like that in the demo since thats only 10min
but here if you get too strong it gets really boring
yeahhh
i personally prefer it not getting easier
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
some people like that some people dont
i dont think the game should become easier as you play, but rather be more skill based
i considered it but i dont think i want that
and potentially in the future allowing you to change starter weapon at a specific level
but it doesnt actually do anything other than showing how much youve played them
yeah
rank is like the overall level on that specific character, based on how much youve played them
it's just "character level" but it would be confusing if the achievements said "level" and youd think that was your in-game level
yeah i mean for example the gold skins will all be the same, get to rank 99 or something with a character
<@728209924978507818> ik it's not what u suggested but i kinda like the fade lmao
damn ur cookin
im kinda crashing out but i will finish the achievements
yeah but tis the 100 achievements that are üíÄ
it means im cooked
it means i need to create 20 characters * 5 skins which must all be achievements
no it means we are only getting started
yo?
like a fade?
vlad
i kinda like the black one i think, a bit more lowkey than mustard bottle as richard put it
oh
...
which one
whats that
im not gonna sleep tonight
i cant believe the disrespect
?mute <@728209924978507818> 2min "think about your actions"
next time WILL  be a 4 week ban
?warn <@728209924978507818> no j word in general
guys please stop talking about j*bs in general
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
gyro sounding like some villain trying to bring over the main character to the dark side
*what bazziliononjons of dollars*
<:OmegaOmegachad:1400119344138031227>
LOL
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
stabbed em
I saw it with my own eyes
He really did
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
thanks richard
so the meme is just calling a robot clanker?
oh so people are using it that way? thats pretty cringe
is "clanker" allowed?
richard youre the community manager
uuh im not fluent in zoomer so im not sure
yah you have a pretty unique name
thank you roger
<:chadStare:1409953625547210833>
ship it
peak
a gold skin for megachad, but i cant get it right
uuh kinda? i just gave some people perms to mute and warned some of the edgy redditors
i tried this but idk
yeah i hate the golden one idk how to make it look good lol
oh the golden one
it's grandpachad
holy shit true
i think there's a chance even RichardGaming might get on it as well
gonna be sending out hella keys
damn im taking so many notes here
no im just really bad at typing <:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
true, ill try to message some of the tubers, let me know if you know any (like danergouslyfunny)
Lirik my goat
richardgaming forced valorant streamers to play megabonk
thats why we have <@259811831017635840>
i like the way you think Skeletor
ill check it out later im cooking atm
yeah you cooked
(i wish)
Surely when youre done megabonk has multiplayer
Daamn prioritize school tho glgl
I mean this might be legit tho ill have to check
Trust no one
Eh so far ive gotten 50 emails from people pretending to be youtubers abd asking for keys so they can review (sell the keys for profit)
thats already a weapon :D
d6 is a classic tho
lol
d20 would be kinda sick tho i agree
but that would require a remodel üíÄ
truueee
here you go, this is dicehead skins for example
you can scroll up a bit in <#1323666051866558565>  to see some
recolors
other than that theres no cosmetics tho
most characters already have 5+ skins
gg
damn ive been demoted to unc
sorry im a bit slow with the references
oh
hm true, we only have move speed sock
we do already have a ninja but he's got a katana instead of throwing stars
good luck ü´°
ok i wont ask
oh shit whats happening in the uk?
it's $10 and there'll be a launch discount :))
its only $200
lol hes joking
thats a great idea
thanks for ruining the secret richardgaming
well i guess its not so secret anymore
it'kll be a secret achievement tho
prevent fall damage by hugging the wall
yeah he can already climb so that item is kinda lame
maybe you unlock the richard character if you do it
oh okay right
what should the unlock be tho? surely an item that has something to do with fall damaage
im actually making it best believe
true, you're the 2nd person to complain about cl4nks bullet, but i simply did not have the budget so he will keep shooting bullets from his belly :D
yeah sorry tahts my bad, i knew something was off when richardstare was not the first reaction
and you were truly right about that perell, just look at Shadow Bear <3
thanks perell
damn
üóø
üòé
i have an extra 2 weeks to do it
yeeh good call
Nopeeee
probably lmao
Yeha idk theres so many new items and pasives i have no idea whats meta
<:Megachad:1353679516957933618>
But it doesnt crit, so cl4nk passive would be useless with poison
Yeh
Theres an item that scales armor and overheal witj number of poisoned enemies, so that could do well against final swarm
Poison has been very buffed
Actually maybe there is a very solid one
Yeah but im not so sure about specifically final swarm, since poison takes time to build up damage
cya
it's a bit different than the demo yeah but there arent variations
nah
i was thinking of it yeah, but dont wanna nerf things too much either
yeah at that point we might just give you the option at the start of a round to start with a 1.5x stat of your choice
uuh i think it would be the same issue tbh, it's still just so good that youd have to reset for it to get a leaderboard run
but maybe ill make a "classic" map for all the demo enjoyers lmao
yeah would be same thing then ig
something somethnig popular block game
it makes runs kinda boring since it's all about resetting
it's not currently used in the full game tho, im not sure how to add it without running into the same problem
yeah the balance shrine is kinda cooked, didnt realize thats how people were going to use it but it makes sense
so they reset until they get a high value
the BA value there shows how many balance shrines on this seed
cant remember what its called in the settings
yeeh if you look in the bottom left of their screen they've turned on some debug
they are reseting for balance shrines
what kind of shrines?
yoo üëã<:Aga:1345906998369189890>
this changes everything
wow thank you richardgaming
richard about to hit his 3rd puberty to get an even deeper voice
so i only update it once a thing is fully done, so thats why it looks completely wrong
yeah
thats fucking insane
wait you were one of the first second generation employees?
np
its not in demo, onyl full game
d
oh my ba
unity i think
no problem <:OmegaAga:1400120744834502768>
believe it or not i havent used any ai for the achievements (real and true)
or maybe you misinterpreted but i wrote it as "im almost finished with all my achievement, just a few more to implement" <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
how is that ai code
yeah but wdym i said ive already made most of the achievements
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
ayo not a bad idea
yeah i think i needed that cuz damn making all the achievements is taking much longer than i expected
so i kinda need em
nah they are used for unlocks
that shit is ROUGH
ooouuuffff
implementing them, getting everything translated
ive already made most of them but like
lmfao <:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
idk i have to finish these damn achievements first tho
yeh i think imma make a better leaderboard with maps and possibly characters
3
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
and now i have the problem of people liking the demo and being used to that gameplay so i cant slow things down too much either
the demo is kinda fun on its own, it's a bit different tho since the gameplay is pretty accelerated
idk
aint got time for that now
so id have to make a brand new demo
but it would probably take quite a bit of effort updating the demo since its a very old and incompatible build
im sorry mr skeletor
Timeless
sorry but as a wise man once said, nothing for you demo fuckers
<:Omegacheese:1395705320562491453>
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
Yeah kill the boss üíÄ
Thats what i tried but you sont get enough xp to level up enough, so you just die
Maybe Thorns Tome?
So maybe that, but it might be doable if you find a good strat idk what that is tho
Not sure, but there is a pacifist one where you have to win without directly damaging enemies (you dont have any weapons) and i spent hours trying to do it with no success
Yoo
Yeah sort of a mix, i enjoy both those games!
Oh yeah im not worried about that achievement, thats like one of the easier ones üíÄ
There are some diabolical achievements that i havent been able to complete yet, so without cheats id say its gonna be some days? But gamers will probably prove me wrong and do it in 20min
:D
but most of them are like super close :p
i should but as ive mentioned before none of the bullet points are really done, so i cant update yet
maybe, im not sure how they work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Like free weekends?
i think thats how i did it
well if you get quantity tome / cooldown tome with the aegis i guess
hmm
it's great for avoiding damage
yeah if you get the aegis first
ooh
what was the unlock requirement again?
not sure yet, ill figure it out once i finish everything. but probably a character or two, weapons and items
ü§ù
get some beefy rings and youve got some big damage
thats a lot of health damn
f
yoo that's smart to decrease the sword size lol
sir oooofie
oooof
and the bosses are constently throwing attacks
once the swarms appear
yeah
surely there will be playtesting
if we do some playtesting you can try then tho :))
nice try bucko
good luck
üòé
it's your problem not mine
man this is probably imposible but whatever
sniper literally has to constantly aim away from enemies
but i think athena is easier since you dont have to aim
oh true sniper can do it too
swarm fucked me
yeah okay this is impossible
i think this is the one
okay i got jump height and an extra jump
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
alr lemme send you a key rq
i fucked up twice already üíÄ
no shot
its really fucked
and then dodge enemies for 10 minutes
she spawns with aegis shield weapon
you gotta play athena lmao
its so fucking hard
survive 10 minutes without dealing any damage
making an evil achievement now
yeeh gotta have a ton of achievements
its a fuckton of work
uuuh we'll see, im still working on making achievements and translating them all üíÄ
hopefully megabonk doesnt completely overshadow it
im more worries about dying light am i right
nah jk
guess we're delaying another 2 weeks
oh shit
lol yeah just chatting
bro is grinding the megabonk god damn
üíÄ
many more will come
many have come before you
uh oh
no problem
If that doesn't work then i don't know, sorry D:
And I would also try reinstalling the game first
I would try this
what kind of broken?
main problem is i dont have any way to know if it was actually a type or not, but remind me in a week and maybe he can get an unban if hes on his best behavior
ai apology not accepted <:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
sus
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
i think he was the guy who said the n word
hmm the guy that was banned yesterday?
why are you asking lol
thnx :)
dont think you can see that
maybe the leaf will finally go away
nicee
truly the megaest of bonks
....all of it?
can you find forgiveness in your heart perell
the music guy is working on a phonk track for megachad so technically we will have megaphonk soon
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
the role is locked on you
doesnt look like i can change your color lol
thank you richardgaming ill let you into the onlyfans shortly
You got me
Megabonk 2 is coming soon
steam political sim fest or something
it's not a steam next fest but a normal steam fest
ill ask them
sorry D:
damn nice run
at least i have your vote for indie of the year
thanks you mr lynx
i dont think we were geting indie game of the year either way <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
what the fuck...
but technically i *am* a playtester
*well in that particular case it was literally just me, but it made for a more interesting plot*
üëÄ
sometimes
yeah there will be so much gambling you dont even know
that poor soul
but steam only allows 100 achievements until the game gets popualr enough to have more
around 100-200 on launch and then ill add more
yeah thats the plan
i hope no one does anything bad to your toaster
mostly just hanging
doing anything to toasters or...?
i have a hunch
üóø
<:OmegaOmegachad:1400119344138031227>
true
so the actual progress in there is more like 80% probably
so like desert map is pretty much done but i havent tested it properly yet
uuh kind of but most of the things in there are like 90% done
oh shit it's the og goat
im actually going to <:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
and im about to fucking lose it
for example i've spent the last 6 hours just making achievements for every single item, weapon, character, etc and translating them all
i will but honestly right now it's a lot of boring work
if i had a dollar every time you suggested this
such a good idea
you like
ü¶∂
megabonk better now?
sure
shit
well
we are going to war
redirect your hate towards silksong
<:OmegaAga:1400120744834502768>
way to punch a guy who is already down
thats fucked up richard
more bananas i guess
oops
alright a number 2 coming right up
ü•ä
alright anyone else want some
?mute <@1135526173993078845> 2h "no cringe bigotry even as a joke it can still hurt people :)"
?mute <@287262100580204545> 1d "no bigotry cringe please"
cant wait for megabong release
thats honestly fine, but silksong is gonna be a huuuge deal so thats like the only game that would delay launch lol
but idk cant delay forever, it's gonna be 11 or 18
but sep 18 week is releasing dying light
yeh problem with the sep 11 week is there is a steam fest going on
shouldve predicted silkson releasing
my bad chat....
yeah it'll be delayed either sep 11 or sep 18
it truly is critical
im cooked
man
true
true
ive heard its bad to release same day as a big release anyway
yeeh it's just that chances of being shown on the steam frontpage decreases by a tooon if i release same day i think
i think.... i might delay it one week
thats the spirit
damn
it ltierally is the most wishlisted steam game
why now lol
thats so fucking unlucky mannnn
yeah i think it can be pretty bad
date might be locked in
not sure if its too late tho
i mean that might actually warrant a week delay tbh
thats actually cooked
fuck meeeee
no way theyre releasing september 4th
bro youre kidding right
üíÄ
Damn
rookie numbers you fools
yep got it all under control yeppp
the emails are not gonna write themselves
you gotta up those numbers richard
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
Youre judt built different ig
im no üß¢
haha thats crazy right
yeah that's the plan
guess we're staying up late
üíÄ  so midnight on friday?
time to go to australia i guess
no way
<@274159725967572992> 2 days...
*technically it is*
yeah if you spawn the boss too late he will cook you
f
what is it
no can do <:OmegaAga:1400120744834502768>
just eat the game, thats like 2 birds with one stone
we do what we must to survive out there fellas
when i was a young lad i might or might not have also been a pirate
i dont care if you pirate it dw
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
you just need higher level <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
but if you delete the banana achievement from your progression file then it will spawn again
nah but once you find it you can buy it from unlocks and get it as a weapon normally
I can confirm chew777 is me
Hes the music goat
Damb imagine
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
chadwell ate him
wait real?
it really is not <:OmegaOmegachad:1400119344138031227>
well this is your warning anyway, if you keep being toxic you'll get a mute and then eventually ban
*if 95% of the server has you blocked then the problem might be you mr googas*
?warn <@287262100580204545> "you really need to stop being so toxic and negative to everything that is being said in the server, it's just creating a toxic environment and it's not really funny"
*you don't*
thank you ü§ù
yepyep <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
yeah soemthing like that
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
ü´°
true but hes not double gaming like you
what about him? about mega super fucking banning?
<@1270017428994261053> bro is GAMING
<:Omegacheese:1395705320562491453>
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
so true
yeh <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
but probably this yeah
ive no idea, im not involved with the mods over there
me too fr
i have no idea
Whoah now thats some crazy advice letsgo
So yah we're really close to checking of a ton of things
Art is basically done just not uploaded yet
Music is done i just havent put it in game yet
Desert is like finished i just havent tested it yet
Yeah i jist havent finish anything on that list yet lol
I think #1 would look better as my desktop background or on my wall or some stupid shit, but #2 catches my attention more
Yeah same im probably way too biased towards the blue one
ü§ù
theres also this one which is a bit of a mix
4..?
hello
gonna need to see that duck art
Uuuuuh not sure maybe?
Pay your respects everybody
No way its john megabonk
Demo is kinda scuffed, fixed in full game. Usually happens if some device or controller is plugged in. Or a driver in some cases
thank you mr roger <3
then open chest once you have a lot of luck so you only get legendaries (and rollerblades)
uuh i think we all forgot tbh, but generally it's CL4nk with damage tome, luck tome and cursed tome, and aura and aegis
thats the plan
once i get a deadline i have to cook so hopefully my brain goes into overdrive
i think i still have like 1 or 2 days to edit it but nah we locking in i gotta release this thing
pretty good
üëã<:Aga:1345906998369189890>
üóø
well im pretty cooked soon anyway because the date will lock in and i literally cant delay it <:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
why would i update the demo in 2 weeks when the game is launchig in 3 <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
*no*
hmmm
thanks pineapple
only like 3 weeks left tho you can do this
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
mercy
loool
sounds like a based guy
ill banish you
you will not
very hype
what the fuck is this image loool
you just stack that shit up
yeah and against bosses
*this is not propaganda*
modly cheese is one of the top gray items trust
but its been buffed a lot now tho
it just does more damage the more stacks you get
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
uuuh not really
im gonna play that on repeat for sure
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
are you hyped taeko? isnt eden album in like a few days?
what the fuck
you dont get it roger
there will be a cheese revolution
moldy cheese is just misunderstood
everyone hates it
hello cat god
ign leaderboad is fine, jsut discord is broken
theres not really any reason to delete it from the progression file unless you are going for wr, because there is a "bug" where if you have 3 weapons and pick up the banana, you can get 4 weapons
so thats how you get it after yuo find it
because after you find it you can pick it as a weapon
but you can open the progression file and delete the banana unlock there if you wanna find it again
once a user
no problem
can only be found once
it's always at a random position unless you already picked it up
yeah
just find it randomly on the map
<:Omegacheese:1395705320562491453>
Isnt he the guy that can eat people with his ult and get really strong or smth
Nasus my beloved
Truuueeeeee
surely
üôè
ive optimized a few things so it might run better in full version
oof
Yeah just gotta make sure steam reviews it lol
ill just launch and then post content updates
fair enough lol, im pretty happy tho, cant keep delaying forever
is bf6 releasing in september?
dont worry im shipping it to them soon, surely they will verify it within 3 weeks time
can you stfu now
the desert boss has the same face as u fr
wait now that i see ur pfp ur kinda in the game googas
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
but i kinda forgot steam has to check my game so need to get a build up for them
ive finished up the desert maps enemies and boss
dont worry
it feels like nothing but i will cook
no xp tho üíÄ
pretty decent
hi
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
Id feel truly blessed üôèüèª
It doesnt mattwr if anyone cheats in a singleplayer game but its a bit annoying to see on the leqderboards yk
Sort of anticheat but only to hide leaderbpard scores
Most cheatengine runs are caught and hidden from leaderboards üóø
It's legit, he even uploaded the run to youtube <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
hello john megabonk
i dont think you do, at least not right now lool
christ
are you in a city where theyre doin that?
stay safe out there mr richard gaming
it's the orange man
you're cooked
we need to smuggle richard to the eu
gl o7
taeko is in possession of all the nanas
let him rest
yore right
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
<:OmegaOmegachad:1400119344138031227>
üëã<:Aga:1345906998369189890>
hi.
..
is it gonna be all fleetwood mac?
no clue
and some stuff with the art and music but cant really show yet
uuh yeah just working on desert map ig
<:Omegacheese:1395705320562491453>
Technically im a playtester right
Nah dont think so
Nah but it doesnt stack linearly so you cant get 100%
Shit take
I cant add runs to the leadervoard manually
risk of rain 2 is a banger ofc
....vampire survivors?
Lol grease spell is great
mcfly would maybe get me in some trouble so it's mczoom lmao
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
he really does
yeah
ig i have a skill issue
hes is telling the true
 -- grot ai
chatpgt uses me
no problem richard
yeah

... sucks?
Wait Mr Megabonk?? Im a big fan
yo
Mega W
Holy shit
now that is a great idea
we're not fixing that it's not a bug it's a feature
megabonk
:)))
surely not
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
*it's releasing early september tho if all goes according to plan so surely we'll see you next month*

Tony McFly
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
offence taken
im not good with naming okay it's like the #1 bottleneck with megabonk
whats a more fitting name? Richard?
you got a problem with jimmy
It was just a short, yk for youtube shorts
This is true
what made you think that?
hes my goat
im an oofie enjoyer
true
<:omegabanana:1395762388426293400>
Yeah the characters was the most time consuming part
yeah idk he might just be too fast
youre the first person to ask for less speed
too fast? bone too shitty?
how come?
he doesnt have a passive yet but attraction is not a bad idea actually
Just the character
it goes hard
haha thats crazy - anything else i can help you with today?
...
some are unique
true
oh shit well if you can hold out for a few more weeks and then explode you should be good
ig im tripping
damn istg you said some shit like that
you literally say it all the time
add googas weapon yourself
didnt you say youre a modding guy?
whats even that? does it shoot out googas dogs?
but it's pretty boring lol
i guess you'll have to see when the game releases :)
yeah!
luck is already probably the best stat in the game
i was thinking of doing that but then i realized it would be way too powerful
yeah ^
it's much simpler and boring unfortunately
actually no
got richardstare in dms 30min after i was in the zone
you missed your window
simple tricks like that wont work on my richardgaming #30
im such an attentive dev
he got his audio update <#1323666051866558565>
truly blessed üôè
should still get some sleep tho <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
okok
Go get some sleep i dont want you to die because of megabonk
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
almost 50-50 split thats optimal
cant remember the exact ratio but its like
You might be cooked
<:OmegaAga:1400120744834502768>
<:OmegaOmegachad:1400119344138031227>
send richardstare
every emote on this server will just be omegachad eating the emoji
<:Omegaskull:1400118565205577850>
üíÄ
no shot
vedour
vetour
that is indeed live thank you vb
do i need programming socks...
there we go 23% !!!!!
im literally working on it as we speak (live)
you win this time richardgaming
damn gg
why trent
<:Omegacheese:1395705320562491453>
thanks taeko great gameplay tips as always
<:Megachad:1353679516957933618>
get a lot of luck before you start buying or opening chests
uuuh
ü¶â
yeah if you get an insane amount of damage you might be able to keep up
id say you need at least 2x and that is barely enough
unlikely, but it might be possible
most active / chill people in the server
just a few of us
though i dont think risks would be too bad, i already post a lot of progress in updates
and to minimize risk of people leaking stuff
Nah i dont think there will be much playtest until the game is almost ready, so it can all be tested
i will procastinate it
alr should be chillin then
i think i had to get it approved for the demo to be approved
or maybe i have already
should probably get that approved
oh shit true
shirley there wont be any delays
only if youre on your best behavior
is this where you say you are an editor for hire?
but editing is so time consuming and i wanna mainly focus on the game yk
one more before launch i think
yeah
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
<:Aga:1345906998369189890>
ill make them S tier to piss you off
yeah theres a few
havent done enough testing to confirm this yet <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
<:Megachad:1353679516957933618>
Hell yeah
D:
have fun <:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
ty
<:Fox:1353679514068320338>
nicee thanks :D
üëã <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
for waht its worth i thought it was a funny joke richardgaming
stealth<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>scope
your doctor was probably just jealous
thats crazy
dammnnnn
<@1021741583479087144> but dm me a screenshot of this when the game is out and ill send you a free key <:Aga:1345906998369189890>
sounds like a myth
220k without aegis is kinda crazy tho
damn thats my bad üíÄ
looool
oh thats fucked
Damn what country / currency?
Lemonade is a nice nickname
Yeah lightning isnt too bad especially if you get a lightning orb
Uh oh
Ooh? What exactly do you mean?
<:omegachad:1395347109158453408>
Blame steam ü•Ä
Letsgoooo
fair enough
if only the writing was as good as the visuals
great show
letsgo big level 2
No bonk tag = ü•Ä
upgrades a random stat when he levels up
oh i ddint see it ig mb
Maybe that's shady guys passive
thats not a bad passive idea
^us
yeah i was expecting a war
just workin on some weapons atm, not sure about the 20th character yet
*after launch*
ill look into it
to pull the actual values and stuff
oh if i can autogenerate some basic pages that people can flesh out that would be cool
are we nuking those places...?
please do, feel free to nuke any of his friends
